Create a class called MathFunctions. It provides following functionalities :
float getMean()
float divideNum()
getMean() function takes an integer array as input and provides the mean of the array elements as output.
The array element should be in the range of 0 to 100. If the number is less than 0 and greater than 100, raise the custom exception ‘InvalidNumber’.
Write an appropriate custom exception class for the same.
divideNum() function takes two integer numbers as input from the user and provides the result of division (number1/number2).
If the number2 entered by the user is zero, raise the build in exception for ‘Divide by Zero’.
Create a main class, which will create an object of MathFunctions and call the appropriate method. 
The user can perform the mean calculation or Division task, allow the user to enter the appropriate choice of operation he/she wants to perform. 
how the concept of handling multiple exceptions through a single try block.
